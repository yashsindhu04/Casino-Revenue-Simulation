# Casino Revenue Simulation
*authored by Yash Sindhu*

*developed as a college project*

Simulation of games played in casinos to get an idea of how casinos end up making money. Monte carlo simulation concepts have been used in the games.

## Slot Machines
- Slot machines are the easiest and the most popular game of the casino
- Casinos have an average return rate of 89%.
- For my slot machine, the return rate will be set at 90%.

Suppose there are 200 spins every hour for 12 hours of the day which amounts to 2400 spins a day with a bet ranging from 5$ to 100$.

### *365 day simulation*
- Total profit over 365 days is 113,378$
- Average daily profit is 310$
- Maximum daily profit is 52,663$
- Least daily profit is -84,660$

Yearly profits for multiple machines simulated simultaneously:

There are 500 slot machines on an average in a casino.
Each machine is averaging 650,000$ yearly profit.
Which means 500 of these machines make 325 million $ each year on an average.  

The odds behind the slot machine:

*Assumptions*
1. Upto 7 players can play at the table
2. 100 spins a day with a bet ranging from 5 to 5000$

### Simulation
- Total profit over 300 days is 23,369,220$
- Total amount betted is 453,149,710$
- House edge is 5.16%
- Average daily profit is 77,897$

There are about 10 roulette tables in a casino that makes a profit of 300 million $ from roulette tables per year from my simulations.

## Conclusion
Casinos always end up making money in the long run.

Winning money in casinos is not likely and you should stick to games like blackjack if any where your odds of winning money are better.
