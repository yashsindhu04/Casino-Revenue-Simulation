### Casino Revenue Simulation
*authored by Yash Sindhu*
*developed as a college project*
Simulation of games played in casinos to get an idea of how casinos end up making money. Monte carlo simulation concepts have been used in the games.

#Slot Machines
- Slot machines are the easiest and the most popular game of the casino
- Casinos have an average return rate of 89%.
- For my slot machine, the return rate will be set at 90%.

Suppose there are 200 spins every hour for 12 hours of the day which amounts to 2400 spins a day with a bet ranging from 5$ to 100$.

#*365 day simulation*
Total profit over 365 days is 113,378$
Average daily profit is 310$
Maximum daily profit is 52,663$
Least daily profit is -84,660$

There are 500 slot machines on an average in a casino.
Each machine is averaging 650,000$ yearly profit.
Which means 500 of these machines make 325 million $ each year on an average.
