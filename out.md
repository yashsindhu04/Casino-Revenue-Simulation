# Introduction

A major part of a casinoâ€™s income comes from the various games they play\.

Each and every one of their games is based on probability\.

Slot machines are the most profitable sources of income for a casino\.

Good strategies help the casinos earn more money by taking advantage of people\.

I have attempted to run simulations to demonstrate how casinos earn money through slot machines and roulette\, their most popular games\.

Slot Machines

Poker

Roulette

Blackjack

Baccarat

Bingo

and several other table\, machine and random number games\.

# Games

# Slot machines

The easiest and the most popular game of the casino

Casinos have an average return rate of 89%\.

For my slot machine\, the return rate will be set at 90%\.

# The simulation code

# 7 day simulation

statistics

graph

Total profit over 7 days is 8\,337$

Average daily profit is 1191$

Maximum daily profit is 19\,987$

Least daily profit is \-24\,426$

# 30 day simulation

statistics

graph

Total profit over 30 days is 28\,627$

Average daily profit is 954$

Maximum daily profit is 46\,488$

Least daily profit is \-51\,015$

# 365 day simulation

statistics

graph

Total profit over 365 days is 113\,378$

Average daily profit is 310$

Maximum daily profit is 52\,663$

Least daily profit is \-84\,660$

# Yearly profits for multiple machines

# Money made

There are 500 slot machines on an average in a casino\.

Each machine is averaging 650\,000$ yearly profit\.

Which means 500 of these machines make 325 million $ each year on an average\.

# Odds of my slot machine

# The simulation code

# Roulette simulation

Total profit over 300 days is 23\,369\,220$

Total amount betted is 453\,149\,710$

House edge is 5\.16%

Average daily profit is 77\,897$

# Money made

There are about 10 roulette tables in a casino\.

That makes a profit of 300 million $ from roulette tables per year from my simulations\.

# Conclusion

Casinos always end up making money in the long run\.

Winning money in casinos is not likely and you should stick to games like blackjack if any where your odds of winning money are better\.
